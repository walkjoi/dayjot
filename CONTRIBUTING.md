# Contributing to DayJot

Thanks for helping build DayJot. This is the short version; the full
contributor/agent guide lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and the architecture
decisions in
[docs/plans/architecture-conventions.md](docs/plans/architecture-conventions.md).

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev    # full desktop app (requires the Rust toolchain)
pnpm dev          # frontend only, no native shell
```

## Before you open a PR

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test --run <paths you touched>
pnpm lint
cargo test        # from apps/desktop/src-tauri, if you touched Rust
```

## PR titles

PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
— CI enforces the format. The repo squash-merges, so your PR title becomes the
commit message and, for `feat`/`fix`, the user-facing changelog entry.

- `feat: …` — new behavior; bumps the minor version (of the next beta and stable).
- `fix: …` — a fix; bumps the patch version (of the next beta and stable).
- `docs:` / `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` / `refactor:` / `build:` — no release,
  no changelog entry.
- DayJot is an app, not a library: `feat!:` and `BREAKING CHANGE:` footers are
  not used (CI rejects `!`). Going 1.0 someday is a product decision: set a
  one-time `release-as` in the release-please configs so the Release PRs offer
  `1.0.0-beta.N` and `1.0.0`, then drop it once both have merged.
- Write the title as user-visible behavior (`fix: keep the daily caret in view
  on long iOS notes`), not implementation detail.
- The changelog is scoped to `apps/desktop/`: a change that should appear in it
  must touch that directory. Core changes usually ship alongside their
  desktop-side counterpart; a pure `packages/core` fix that lands alone still
  ships in the next release, it just gets no changelog line.
- GitHub's Revert button writes `Revert "…"`; retitle it to `revert: …`.

## Where code goes

- **Business logic → `packages/core`.** No file/DB/AI logic in React
  components, hooks, or Tauri command handlers. Components call typed
  `@dayjot/core` bindings; Rust commands are thin wrappers over native
  primitives.
- **Rust owns capabilities, TypeScript owns policy.** A Rust command never
  encodes a product rule beyond the primitive it exposes (e.g. the watcher
  emits events; *what* to reindex is decided in core).
- **`@dayjot/core` and `@dayjot/db` never import Tauri.** Native access goes
  through the injected bridge (`setBridge`); tests install fakes instead of
  module mocks.

## Conventions that are checked in review

- TypeScript: strict, no `any` (ever), zod at external boundaries,
  kebab-case filenames, one React component per file, named exports,
  explicit return types on public functions.
- Keep modules small and single-responsibility; extract logic from components
  into hooks or pure modules so it's testable without rendering.
- Document every public API with a doc comment that explains *why*, not what.
  Comments that restate the code get dropped in review.
- Tests are the behavioral documentation: cover the invariants of anything you
  add, colocated as `*.test.ts(x)` (TS) or `#[cfg(test)]` (Rust).

## Hard product rules

- Notes with `private: true` frontmatter must never reach an external service.
  Enforce at every call site.
- Markdown files are the source of truth; SQLite under `.dayjot/` is a
  rebuildable cache. Never make the index durable.
- No DayJot-hosted APIs, no Electron, secrets only in the OS keychain.

## Guides

Step-by-step walkthroughs for the most common kinds of change:

- [Adding a native command](docs/contributing/adding-a-command.md) — the full
  Rust → bridge → zod → React path, with conventions and a checklist.
- [Adding a user setting](docs/contributing/adding-a-setting.md) — schema key,
  defaults-by-construction, the settings screen. (No Rust involved.)
- [Editor architecture](docs/contributing/editor-architecture.md) — the
  session/adapter split, the save loop, and where new editor code goes.

## "Plan NN" in comments?

Numbered plans in [docs/plans/](docs/plans/) are the implementation roadmap;
a comment citing "Plan 04b" points at that plan's design rationale. Start with
[docs/plans/00-overview.md](docs/plans/00-overview.md).
