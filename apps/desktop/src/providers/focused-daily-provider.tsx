/**
 * Which day in the daily stream currently holds the user's focus, so the
 * context sidebar can describe *that* day rather than the routed one.
 *
 * The daily stream is a run of per-day editors under a single `daily/:date`
 * route: scrolling or clicking to another day moves focus but never changes the
 * route (only the calendar does). Without this, the right sidebar — derived
 * purely from the route — stays pinned to the routed day while the user edits a
 * different one, so its note actions (pin, private, publish) and the published
 * URL all describe the wrong note.
 *
 * The stream is the only writer (it sets the focused day on focus); the
 * workspace shell reads it and falls back to the routed day when nothing in the
 * stream is focused — which is also the calendar-pick path. Split into separate
 * value/setter contexts so the heavy stream can consume the (stable) setter
 * without re-rendering every time the focused day changes.

 * On a daily view the sidebar describes the focused day, not the routed one (the
 * stream keeps a single `daily/:date` route as focus moves between days) — the
 * {@link effectiveDailyDate} precedence the note-scoped commands share. Focus
 * deliberately *stays* through transient moves — opening ⌘K, clicking a sidebar
 * button — rather than flicking back and out again: what restores the routed day
 * is navigation, not blur. So the reset keys off the same signals the stream
 * re-anchors on (`arrivalSeq`/`entryId`), not the routed date, so re-targeting
 * the current day (a calendar pick on it, ⌘D to today) snaps back too. It runs
 * pre-paint (a layout effect) so no stale day shows before the stream re-focuses
 * the target; with nothing focused it is just the routed subject.
