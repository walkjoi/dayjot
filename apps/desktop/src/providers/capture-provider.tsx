 * the native-messaging host (pointer file + browser manifests, rewritten on
 * every graph open so app moves self-heal) and runs the
 * {@link createCaptureController} drain/enrich loop. No UI — capture has no
 * in-app surface; the capture front end is the Chrome extension on desktop
 * and the share extension on iOS, and the daily note is the output.
 *
 * On the mobile surface there is no native-messaging host to register;
 * instead every pass first relays the App Group inbox the iOS share
 * extension spools into, and the controller re-runs on app resume.
