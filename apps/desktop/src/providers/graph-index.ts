 *
 * Usage on a graph switch (the caller still gates on its own open token):
 *
 * ```ts
 * await index.stop()                       // halt the previous graph's sync pass
 * const generation = await index.open()    // open the new graph's index
 * if (stale) return
 * index.sync(generation, () => stale)      // background reconcile + live watch
 * ```
 *
 * Every write carries the index `generation` returned by {@link GraphIndex.open};
 * Rust no-ops a write whose generation is stale, so even a pass that races a
 * connection swap can't corrupt the newly-opened index.
