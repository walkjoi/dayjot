 * pinned — and runs no index lifecycle of its own. The Rust `index:written`
 * broadcast (fired after the main window's applies commit) keeps this
 * window's index-backed queries fresh, and the window's initial deep link
 * rides the ordinary intake, buffering until the workspace's
 * DeepLinkProvider attaches.
