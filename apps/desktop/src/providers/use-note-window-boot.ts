/**
 * Boot leg for a secondary note window (⌘-click → new window, Plan 06): it
 * ADOPTS the main window's open session — never `graph_open`/`index_open`,
 * whose generation bumps would strand every command the main window has
 * pinned — and runs no index lifecycle of its own. The Rust `index:written`
 * broadcast (fired after the main window's applies commit) keeps this
 * window's index-backed queries fresh.
 *
 * The initial deep link seeds the router directly whenever it resolves
 * synchronously (⌘-click builds path-shaped links), so the window's first
 * workspace render is already the clicked note — no flash of today's daily
 * note. Only a target that needs the index (an id/title-shaped link) rides
 * the ordinary intake, buffering until DeepLinkProvider attaches.
 *
 * A no-op everywhere else (main window, mobile, browser dev).
