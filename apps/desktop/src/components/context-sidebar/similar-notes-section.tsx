 * may be disabled or the note not yet embedded, and an empty box would just
 * advertise a missing feature. Query errors are deliberately just as quiet:
 * a failing semantic leg means an optional feature is unavailable, not that
 * the index is broken. Shared by the daily and note context sidebars.
