/**
 * The `Needs review` banner + resolution actions for a note whose file
 * carries sync conflict markers (a backup merge where this and another
 * device edited the same note, Plan 12).
 *
 * Conflict markers don't survive the editor's markdown round-trip (the
 * discovery spike showed `=======` re-parsing as a setext underline and both
 * marker lines mangling), so conflicted notes open **protected** — the raw
 * source is visible but not editable. Resolution therefore happens here, as
 * a pure text splice over the raw file ({@link useConflictResolution}):
 * keep this device's side, the other device's, or both. Either way nothing
 * is lost — every version remains in the backup history. The flag is a
 * projection of the file content, so the banner clears itself once the
 * resolved file reindexes.
 *
 * On mobile, conflicts are contained, not resolved (Plan 19): the same
 * protected session contract, but the resolution actions stay desktop-side —
 * the banner says the note needs review on desktop and offers nothing else.
