 *
 * - The edit **baseline is frozen at open**: `task` is the live row, and if a
 *   reindex rewrites it while the sheet is up, comparing the untouched draft
 *   against the *new* content would read as an edit and commit stale text
 *   over the external change.
 * - The sheet stays mounted after closing (the exit animation needs content),
 *   so **reopening reseeds everything** — baseline and draft from the row's
 *   current raw (an action may have rewritten it), the handled flag, and the
 *   caller's presentation via `onReseed` — else a visit after Complete/
 *   Convert/Open note would silently drop its edits on dismiss.
 * - **Abandoning** (dismissal gesture, or a route change unmounting the open
 *   sheet) commits a changed draft, and deletes an emptied *or
 *   abandoned-empty* one — a "+"-added row left untyped must not ghost a bare
 *   `+ [ ]` in the note (V1's empty-task rule).
 * - **Navigating** ("Open note") commits a change and deletes an emptied
 *   draft, but never applies the abandoned-empty rule: an untouched empty
 *   task must not lose the very line the navigation shows.
