/**
 * Keeps an iCloud-stored graph fresh while the app is used (Plan 21).
 *
 * Mobile has no file watcher — local writes notify in-process, and for git
 * graphs remote changes only arrive through pull. iCloud is different: the
 * OS lands files in the container behind the app's back, and on iOS it
 * doesn't even download them until asked. The metadata-query watch nudges
 * downloads live while the app is open; this hook covers the resume seams
 * the query can miss: on every resume it nudges the pending downloads and
 * re-runs the index reconcile, and while placeholders remain it polls the
 * pending *count* (never re-requesting), reconciling the moment downloads
 * land instead of waiting for the next resume.
 *
 * The on-open trigger only nudges: the open itself just synced the index
 * against local disk, so an immediate second full pass would repeat that
 * work — on a first sync of a large graph, at the worst possible moment.
 *
 * Downloads are sequenced notes-first: the nudge and the poll cover only
 * markdown under the note directories, and the full-scope request (assets,
 * recordings) fires once the note count drains — so a first sync's bulk
 * bytes never compete with the first index pass.
 *
 * Inert unless an iCloud graph is open (`mobileStorageKind === 'icloud'`).
