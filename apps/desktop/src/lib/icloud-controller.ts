 * - Starts/stops the native metadata-query watch.
 * - Debounces `icloud:conflicts` signals and external file-change batches
 *   into conflict sweeps (`icloud_conflicts_scan`).
 * - Classifies external arrivals (not this device's own writes — tracked via
 *   the own-write echo — and not the sweep's own output) as clean ingests,
 *   which advance the notes' shadow merge bases.
 * - Fans a sweep's rewrites to every file-change subscriber and reindexes
 *   them directly, exactly like the backup controller's pull path.
 * - Sweeps again on resume/focus: the metadata query only covers the app's
 *   own container, so graphs the user placed in the general iCloud Drive
 *   folder get no conflict signal — and a conflict version can appear
 *   without the working file changing, which the `notify` watcher can't see
 *   either. The resume sweep is the backstop for both.
 *
 * Dirty open sessions are deferred (their paths ride `skipPaths`) as a
 * courtesy, not a safety net — even without it, a sweep write lands on disk
 * and the session's own external-change reconciliation parks it as a
 * conflict, the same as any external edit.
