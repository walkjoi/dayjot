/**
 * Per-entry scroll memory for a route that owns its own scroll container — the
 * All Notes / Tasks shape, not `ScrollRestored`'s. Restores the saved offset on
 * back/forward and resets to the top on re-arrival (the router clears the offset
 * for that case, so `arrivalSeq` re-runs the effect). `ready` gates the restore
 * on the content being loaded: restoring against an empty, zero-height container
 * would clamp the offset to 0 and lose the position.
 *
 * Takes the scroll element itself (not a ref) so the restore re-runs once it
 * mounts — a virtualized container already holds it in state for its virtualizer,
 * and a plain one can with a callback ref. Returns the `onScroll` handler to put
 * on the scroll container.
