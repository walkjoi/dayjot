/**
 * The note's semantic neighbors ("Similar notes"), one query shared by every
 * surface that shows them (the in-note panel and the context sidebars). The
 * key shape is the contract with the index invalidation hook, so it is built
 * here exactly once; the graph root is part of the key because cached rows
 * must never outlive a graph switch.
 *
 * Gated on `semanticSearchEnabled` so disabling semantic search empties every
 * surface immediately: the query stops fetching, and the cached rows are
 * masked too — a disabled query still reports its last data, and stored
 * vectors would otherwise keep answering for the rest of the session.
