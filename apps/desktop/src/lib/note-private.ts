/**
 * Toggle a note's `private` frontmatter flag — the hard block that keeps the
 * note's content away from AI and every other external service. It is privacy
 * from cloud services, not encryption or a local-search filter (the product
 * vision's contract). Markdown is the source of truth: the flag lands in the
 * file, the watcher re-indexes it, and `notes.isPrivate` follows from the
 * index — no UI-side privacy state. Toggling off removes the key entirely:
 * not-private is the absence of the flag, and frontmatter stays minimal.
 *
 * Reads the current state and writes the flip through {@link readNoteSource} /
 * {@link commitNoteFrontmatter}, exactly like `toggleNotePinned`: the shared
 * session-or-disk channel keeps our own write from parking a conflict under a
 * dirty buffer (and never reads a still-loading buffer). Toggling off removes
 * the key entirely — not-private is the absence of the flag, and frontmatter
 * stays minimal.
 *
 * Returns the note's new private state.
