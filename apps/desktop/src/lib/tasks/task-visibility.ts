/**
 * The Tasks list every surface renders (Plan 18): open rows merged with the
 * struck "completed" rows, searched, grouped ({@link groupTasks}) and narrowed to
 * the buckets the filters allow. Shared by the desktop screen and the mobile
 * Tasks tab so the two can't drift on the merge rules:
 *
 * - With archived on, the completed query is the full history — but a
 *   just-completed task may not be in it until the reindex refetches (and the
 *   query reloads blank when the filter first flips on), so the session set is
 *   unioned on top, deduped. With archived off, the session set is the only
 *   source of struck rows.
 * - Any open row also present struck is dropped from the open side — a refetch
 *   can briefly restore a just-completed task to the open cache before the
 *   reindex lands, and listing it both open and struck collides React keys.
 *   That shadow is only ever transient: a task genuinely reopened at its source
 *   note leaves the session set via `reconcileRecentlyCompleted` (its reindexed
 *   row carries a newer `updatedAt`), so the live open row takes over.
