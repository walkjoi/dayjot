/**
 * The "recently completed" set (Plan 18) — V1's middle state where a checked task
 * keeps showing (struck) in the list until you archive it. It's deliberately a
 * **view-only, ephemeral** set, not durable state: a checked task is already
 * `[x]` on disk, and "archived" only means "stop showing it in the active list",
 * which the markdown can't (and shouldn't) encode. So it resets on app restart;
 * it survives navigating away from Tasks and back (a module singleton, above any
 * one screen mount).
 *
 * Tracking the session's completions — rather than every `[x]` task — is what
 * keeps a fresh launch clean: only what you checked *this run* lingers struck;
 * the whole historical pile stays behind the "show archived" filter.
 *
 * The set yields to the index when it disagrees: a task reopened at its source
 * note (the checkbox flipped back to `[ ]` in the editor) comes back through the
 * open-tasks read, and {@link reconcileRecentlyCompleted} drops the struck copy
 * so the live row shows instead of a stale `[x]` shadow.
 *
 * Scoped to a graph root: switching graphs (whose task paths differ) yields an
 * empty set rather than the previous graph's rows.
