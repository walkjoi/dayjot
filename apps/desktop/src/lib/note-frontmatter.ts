/**
 * The single safe way to read and write a note's frontmatter from an in-app
 * action (pin, private, gist publish). Each used to hand-roll the same
 * session-or-disk dance; the two sharp edges live here once instead of three
 * times:
 *
 * - **Reads** prefer the open session's *loaded* buffer, never a still-loading
 *   one. A loading session reports `liveContent() === null` (its empty buffer
 *   isn't the truth yet), so we fall back to disk rather than act on a
 *   placeholder — the trap behind empty publishes and mis-read toggle states.
 * - **Writes** go through the session when it can take the patch (so our own
 *   write never parks a conflict under a dirty buffer), else a read-patch-write
 *   on disk that a loading/clean session reconciles like any external edit.
 *   Both encode the flag through {@link frontmatterPatchToYaml}, so a value
 *   lands identically whichever channel wins.
