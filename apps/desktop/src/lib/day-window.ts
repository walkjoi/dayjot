 * The daily surfaces' virtual window (Plan 06b / Plan 19): a **fixed**
 * chronological range of days around an anchor, indexed `0 … count-1` from
 * oldest to newest. Virtual rows/slides are free until mounted, so a generous
 * static window sidesteps bidirectional infinite scroll's prepend/scroll-
 * compensation problem entirely. Index↔date is pure offset math.
 *
 * Two surfaces share this module: the desktop daily stream (a wide, asymmetric
 * window it virtualizes with TanStack Virtual) and the mobile day carousel (a
 * tighter symmetric window Embla pages through). They differ only in radius and
 * in how they treat a date outside the window — see {@link indexOfDate} (clamps
 * to the nearest edge) versus {@link indexWithin} (reports `-1` so the caller
 * can re-anchor around the far date).
