 * Boot-time head start for the mobile storage resolve (Plan 21). Resolving
 * the iCloud container (`URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier` plus the graph
 * scan) is the slowest IPC on the mobile boot path, and it depends on
 * nothing else — not settings, not React. {@link warmMobileStorage} starts
 * the call as soon as the shell reports a mobile platform, so it overlaps
 * the mobile chunk's fetch/eval and the settings read instead of running
 * after both; the graph bootstrap adopts the in-flight promise via
 * {@link takeWarmMobileStorage}.
 *
 * Consume-once by design: the warm slot is a boot hint, not a cache.
 * Storage roots must be derived fresh everywhere else (container paths
 * change across restore/update), so a taken — or never-started — slot just
 * means the consumer makes its own fresh call.
