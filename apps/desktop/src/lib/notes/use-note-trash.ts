 *
 * - **Optimistic removal is required, not cosmetic.** On desktop the list only
 *   refreshes when the file watcher's reindex batch applies — a visible beat
 *   after the delete. The single-note action sidesteps this by navigating away;
 *   the bulk action stays on the screen, so it drops each row from every cached
 *   list variant (the `all-notes` key prefix — a trashed note leaves every tag
 *   view) as that note's delete lands. Removing per-success, not all up front,
 *   keeps a failed note in the list — and therefore in the selection, which
 *   prunes only vanished rows — so the user can retry it without re-selecting.
 * - **{@link deleteOpenNote}, not raw `deleteNote`.** It discards any open
 *   editor session for the note after the file is gone, so a teardown flush
 *   can't recreate the file. It also guards daily notes (which All Notes never
 *   lists, so this is only defense in depth).
 * - **Per-note failures don't strand the rest.** Deletes run sequentially and a
 *   failure is recorded, not rethrown mid-batch, so the remaining notes still
 *   trash; the toast reports the count couldn't-trash via the last error.
