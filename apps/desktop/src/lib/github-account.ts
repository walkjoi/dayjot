 * The machine-level GitHub identity (not graph-scoped, unlike the backup
 * controller): resolves the stored credential to who it belongs to via
 * `GET /user`. Doubles as token validation — the connect flow calls this
 * right after a credential is stored so a mistyped token fails at entry
 * ("GitHub rejected the token") instead of minutes later at the first sync.
 *
 * Returns `null` when no credential is stored. A credential GitHub rejects
 * is **cleared** before the auth error is rethrown — keeping it would make
 * every later flow skip the sign-in step and fail somewhere worse. The
 * clear is conditional on the keychain still holding the token GitHub
 * actually rejected: a slow rejection of an old credential (the auth step
 * probes on mount) must not wipe a newer one saved while it was in flight.
