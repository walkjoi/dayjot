/**
 * How the running surface differs from stock desktop, as module-scope facets
 * set once by the mobile root chunk at load — before any consumer renders —
 * the same pattern as core's `setLocalWriteEcho`. One module so the facets
 * don't multiply as parallel single-flag files.
 *
 * Facets are deliberately separate (a future iPad-with-keyboard build could
 * plausibly split them):
 * - `touchEditor` — editors apply iOS text-input hygiene (pinned
 *   `spellcheck=false`: WebKit derives the keyboard's smart-punctuation
 *   traits from it, and smart punctuation corrupts markdown syntax) and
 *   explicit input traits — see `EditorInputTraits` (Plan 19, decision 7).
 * - `mobileApp` — shared components render their mobile-v1 variants, e.g.
 *   sync-conflict resolution stays desktop-side so the conflict notice
 *   points at desktop instead of offering actions (Plan 19).
