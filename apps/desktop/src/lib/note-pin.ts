/**
 * Toggle a note's `pinned` frontmatter flag. Markdown is the source of truth:
 * the flag lands in the file, the watcher re-indexes it, and the sidebar's
 * Pinned section follows from the index — no UI-side pin state. Toggling off
 * always clears any explicit `pinned: <order>`; toggling on writes a bare
 * `pinned: true` (the reorder UI, when it lands, is what writes orders).
 *
 * Reads the current state and writes the flip through {@link readNoteSource} /
 * {@link commitNoteFrontmatter} — the shared session-or-disk channel that keeps
 * our own write from parking a conflict under a dirty buffer (and never reads a
 * still-loading buffer). `pinned: false` deletes the key: unpinned is the
 * absence of the flag, so a note whose only metadata was the pin returns to
 * having no frontmatter at all.
 *
 * Returns the note's new pinned state.
