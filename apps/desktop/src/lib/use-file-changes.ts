/**
 * Subscribe to the watcher's file-change events (Plan 04b) for the lifetime of
 * the component. Owns the fiddly parts of the subscription lifecycle so call
 * sites don't re-implement them:
 *
 * - events delivered after teardown are dropped (the unsubscribe is async, so
 *   a change can race the cleanup);
 * - an unlisten that resolves *after* teardown is closed immediately instead
 *   of leaking;
 * - without a bridge (browser dev) the hook is a no-op.
 *
 * The subscription follows the handler's identity: memoize the handler over
 * its real dependencies and the hook resubscribes exactly when they change.
 * Pass `null` to disable.
