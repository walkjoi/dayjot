/**
 * Publish a note's body to a GitHub Gist (always secret), recording the gist
 * in the note's `gist` frontmatter block. A note that already carries the
 * block republishes to the **same** gist — addressing the file by the name it
 * was last published under, so a title change renames instead of adding a
 * second file. A gist deleted on github.com falls back to creating a fresh
 * one. The stored hash is of the body as published, so the indexer's
 * `gist_stale` reflects real edits, never the frontmatter write itself.
 *
 * Reads and writes through the shared {@link readNoteSource} /
 * {@link commitNoteFrontmatter} channel, exactly like the pin/private toggles:
 * a direct disk write under a dirty buffer would park a conflict caused by our
 * own action, and a still-loading session is read from disk rather than from
 * its empty placeholder buffer.
 *
 * `private: true` is the hard block: the gate runs on the content actually
 * being published (live, not the possibly-lagging index), and it fails
 * closed before any byte leaves the device.
