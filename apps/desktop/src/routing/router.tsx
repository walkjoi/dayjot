 * browser), `back`/`forward` move the cursor. Mount it per graph (keyed by the
 * graph root) so switching graphs starts a fresh history.
 *
 * Each history entry can carry a **scroll offset** (Plan 06b): views report
 * theirs via `saveScrollState` (a ref write — safe from scroll handlers, never
 * re-renders) and read `savedScroll()` after a back/forward restores an entry.
 *
 * Long-lived surfaces (the daily canvas, shared by the today/daily routes)
 * additionally keep a **surface offset** — the last reported position,
 * independent of any history entry — so a nav-tab return can resume the
 * canvas where the user left it (`restoreSurfaceScroll`) even though it
 * lands on a fresh entry.
