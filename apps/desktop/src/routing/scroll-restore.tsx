 * a history entry is revisited via back/forward. Used by the plain full-height
 * views — the daily canvas, the note route, search.
 *
 * The container is positioned (`relative`) so absolutely-positioned
 * descendants — `sr-only` controls especially — resolve against it and scroll
 * with the content. Without it they escape to the workspace column at their
 * static offsets, overflowing the frame into a second scrollbar.
