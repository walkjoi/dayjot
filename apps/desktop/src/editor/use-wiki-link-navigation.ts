/**
 * Navigation for a clicked `[[wiki link]]`: resolve via the index, then open
 * the target. An unresolved ISO date is still a valid daily target (created
 * lazily on first write), and an unresolved non-empty title is created and
 * opened on the spot — Plan 07's create-from-unresolved, consistent with lazy
 * dailies. With no graph generation available, unresolved titles are a no-op
 * (nothing can be written).
 *
 * A ⌘-click (the originating `event`, when the caller passes it) opens the
 * resolved target in a secondary note window instead — falling back to
 * in-window navigation whenever the surface can't (browser dev, mobile), so
 * the modifier never makes a link do nothing. Keyboard follows (Mod-Enter)
 * deliberately stay in-window: their modifier is held by definition.
 *
 * Resolution is async, and the host pane can unmount while it's in flight
 * (route change, graph switch) — a late navigate would yank the user somewhere
 * they've already left, so the hook guards every navigation on its own
 * lifetime.
 *
 * @param generation the open graph's write generation (`GraphInfo.generation`),
 *   or `null` when no graph is writable.
 * @returns a stable-per-`generation` click handler for the editor's wiki-link
 *   extension.
