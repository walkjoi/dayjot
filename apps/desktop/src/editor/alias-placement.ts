/**
 * Old-title alias placement after a settled rename (Plan 07b): the renamed
 * note records the title it renamed *away from* as an alias, so any inbound
 * link the rewrite missed (or couldn't reach) still resolves to this note.
 *
 * Placement routes through the live session whenever the note is open — in
 * the renaming pane or a *reopened* one (the open-documents service is the
 * one liveness signal). A direct disk write under a reopened dirty buffer
 * would park a conflict caused by our own background work, and "keep mine"
 * would silently drop the alias. Only when no session can take the patch
 * does the alias go straight to disk; a loading/clean session reconciles it
 * like any external change, and a header-only patch is body-safe even for
 * protected notes.
