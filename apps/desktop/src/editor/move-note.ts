/**
 * Move a note's file + projection, carrying any live editor session along
 * (Plan 17). Ordering is the mechanism: flush, retarget the session (so any
 * later save writes the *new* path), re-key the open-documents registry, then
 * move file + index rows in one Rust transaction. A failure — including an
 * occupied destination, which Rust always refuses — undoes exactly what was
 * done: the session retargets back only if one was carried, and the registry
 * re-key is identity-guarded so it can never grab a different pane's
 * document; then it rethrows. On success every subscriber (the router's
 * history rewrite, adopting panes) hears about it. Shared by the rename
 * pipeline and the 17c migration.
 *
 * Retarget-before-move is deliberate. A save can only land mid-move if the
 * user edits inside the single IPC round-trip that follows a flush behind a
 * 5s save-quiet gate (the debounce alone is 800ms — orders of magnitude
 * wider than the window). If that ever happens, the write lands at the
 * destination — where the note is about to live — and the refused move
 * leaves at worst an orphan copy the duplicate-id surface flags. The
 * alternative order (retarget after) fails worse: the same race would
 * resurrect the *old* path holding the newest bytes while the index points
 * at the new one. See the plan's risk log (decided 2026-06-11).
