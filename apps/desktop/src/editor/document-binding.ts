/**
 * One pane's document lifecycle policy (Plan 17), extracted from
 * `useNoteDocument`'s effect so the create/adopt/teardown/hand-off protocol
 * is explicit and unit-testable instead of implied by ref comparisons.
 *
 * Per **bind** it decides between:
 * - **create** — a fresh session (and coordinator) for the path; the caller
 *   loads it. Any same-path rebind (changed io deps) recreates too: a
 *   session's io bindings are taken at construction.
 * - **adopt** — a rename just retargeted the live session to this path and
 *   the route followed; the document, coordinator, and editor all continue.
 *
 * Per **unbind** it decides between:
 * - **teardown now** — the normal pane close / note switch: unregister,
 *   flush to the session's own path, dispose, settle pending renames.
 * - **hand off** — the session was retargeted away from the unbound path: an
 *   adopting bind() lands synchronously in the same React commit, and only
 *   if none does (the pane really unmounted) does a deferred check tear the
 *   session down — a moved document must never flush over its old home, and
 *   an unadopted one must never leak.
 *
 * The hook's effect drives it like so (see `use-note-document.ts`):
 *
 * ```ts
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   const { session, created } = binding.bind(path, {
 *     coordinator: () => createRenameCoordinator({ ... }),
 *     session: (coordinator) => createNoteSession({ ... }),
 *   })
 *   if (created) session.load()            // adopted sessions are already live
 *   return () => binding.unbind(path)
 * }, [path, ...])
 * // …and the editor is keyed on binding.epoch(), not the path, so a rename
 * // that retargets the session never remounts it — the cursor survives.
 * ```
 *
 * Why a rename leads here: `docs/readable-filenames.md`.
