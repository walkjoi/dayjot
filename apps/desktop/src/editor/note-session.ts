/**
 * The save pipeline + external-change reconciliation for one open note
 * (Plan 05 steps 4–5), as a pure state machine — no React, no editor, no IPC.
 * `useNoteDocument` adapts it to React; tests drive it directly.
 *
 * A session is created for one `path` and lives until {@link NoteSession.dispose}.
 * Binding the path at construction keeps the machine simple: a note switch is
 * "dispose the old session (which flushes its buffer to *its* path), create a
 * new one" — there is no cross-note state to guard. The one sanctioned path
 * mutation is {@link NoteSession.retarget} (Plan 17): a rename moves the
 * *file*, not the document, so the same session continues under the new path
 * — content, dirtiness, and conflict state untouched. Lifecycle policy around
 * that (adopt vs teardown) lives in `document-binding.ts`, not here.
 *
 * Saves are debounced atomic writes (Plan 02); indexing is **not** triggered
 * here — the watcher is the sole incremental-reindex path (Plan 04b), so our own
 * write flows file → watcher → index like any other change. The same watcher
 * event comes back to us; we recognize the echo by content (it matches what we
 * last saved) and ignore it. A real external change reloads a clean buffer
 * imperatively, and **never clobbers a dirty one** — it parks as `conflict` for
 * the user to resolve.
 *
 * **Frontmatter is the session's, not the editor's** (Plan 07b): meowdown
 * mangles a `---` block (it reads as thematic breaks/setext), so the editor
 * sees only the body — the session splits every disk read, keeps the exact
 * header bytes aside, and rejoins them on every write. This is also what makes
 * frontmatter notes editable at all (a joined round-trip classifies lossy),
 * and gives metadata writes ({@link NoteSession.updateFrontmatter}) a channel
 * that never disturbs the editor view.

   * be located) propagates with nothing changed. And the write is all-or-nothing:
