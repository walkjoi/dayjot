//! SQLite index layer (Plan 04).
//!
//! The graph's rebuildable projection lives at `<graph>/.reflect/index.sqlite`,
//! backed by the bundled SQLite (FTS5 compiled in) with sqlite-vec registered for
//! Plan 09. Parsing/extraction happens in TS (`@reflect/core`, Plan 03); this
//! module owns the schema/migrations ([`migrations`]), all writes — one
//! transaction per batch, generation-gated here in the command layer
//! ([`write`] holds the row logic) — plus a read-only `db_query` bridge
//! ([`query`]) that executes the SQL the frontend builds with Kysely. The DB
//! is *mostly* a cache: the note projection is rebuildable from markdown, but
//! the `chat_*` tables ([`chat_write`]) hold durable chat history — deleting
//! the file loses those.
