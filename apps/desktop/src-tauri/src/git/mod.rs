//! Git backup/sync primitives (Plan 12).
//!
//! Rust owns the *capabilities* — init/adopt, commit, fetch, merge, push —
//! while the sync **policy** (debounce cadence, retry loop, product states,
//! GitHub specifics) lives in `@dayjot/core` `sync/`. Nothing here is
//! GitHub-specific: remotes are URLs, credentials arrive per call through a
//! callback (never embedded in the URL, so never on disk).
//!
//! All operations run on blocking threads (network fetches/pushes take
//! seconds) and are **generation-gated** like file writes: every command takes
//! the `generation` the frontend received when its graph was opened and
//! resolves the root through `crate::fs::root_for_generation`, which fails
//! when the active graph's generation has since moved (the user switched
//! graphs after the command was issued). A stale command errors loudly instead
//! of acting on the new graph, so commands never interleave across graphs.
//! The one exception is `git_clone`, which runs before any graph is open.
