//! The `NSFileVersion` surface: what iCloud knows about a file's unresolved
//! conflict versions, and the resolve/cleanup calls (Plan 21).
//!
//! When two devices edit apart, iCloud keeps one content as the current file
//! and stashes the others as conflict versions — full content in the local
//! version store, plus the saving device's name and modification date. The
//! sweep reads them through this module, resolves, then marks the versions
//! handled so iCloud stops reporting the conflict.
