//! The conflict sweep (Plan 21 Phase 2): walk the graph, resolve every
//! iCloud conflict through the deterministic ladder, and report what changed
//! so the caller reindexes directly (never waiting on the watcher — the same
//! contract as the Git merge path).
//!
//! Per conflicted note: archive **every** involved version first (resolution
//! must never be the only copy-holder), fold the conflict versions through
//! [`crate::conflict::ladder`], write the result atomically, then — and only
//! then — mark the provider versions resolved. Creation-collision duplicates
//! (`2026-07-04 2.md`, iCloud's rename when two devices create the same
//! filename apart) are folded back into their canonical file by the same
//! ladder with the union rule enabled.
//!
//! Shadow-base bookkeeping rides the sweep: bases advance on resolutions and
//! on the clean external ingests the frontend reports (`ingested_paths`),
//! and `record_baseline` snapshots a graph on iCloud adoption — never on
//! local saves (see [`crate::conflict::shadow`]).
