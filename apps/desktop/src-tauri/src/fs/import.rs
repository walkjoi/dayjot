//! Reflect V1 export import.
//!
//! Reflect V1 now exports the same markdown graph layout DayJot Open reads:
//! `daily/`, `notes/`, optional `assets/`, plus ignorable local metadata. The
//! import path is therefore a bounded archive extraction into the active graph,
//! not a content migration — with one addition: attachments the notes link
//! straight to Firebase Storage or DayJot's asset CDN are downloaded into
//! `assets/` and the links rewritten (see [`super::import_assets`]).
//!
//! The flow is three phases so nothing lands in the graph until everything is
//! in hand: [`prepare_zip_import`] (read + validate, no writes), the async
//! [`PreparedImport::download_assets`] (network, staging writes only), then
//! [`finalize_import`] (rewrite, atomic writes).
//!
//! Existing graph files never make an import fail, and are never replaced:
//! identical files are skipped, a conflicting note lands under a `-2`-style
//! suffixed name (note links resolve by title, so the filename is free to
//! move), a conflicting daily note has the imported entry's body appended
//! (one day, one note — the merge is idempotent across re-imports), and a
//! conflicting asset lands suffixed with the imported notes' literal
//! `assets/…` links rewritten to follow it. Real V1 imports routinely hit
//! conflicts (re-imports, dailies on both sides, and upstream Reflect's
//! seeded `notes/how-to-use-reflect.md` colliding with a graph that carries
//! one), so a fatal conflict policy would fail practically every import.
