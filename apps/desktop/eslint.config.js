/**
 * ESLint flat config scoped to the React frontend.
 *
 * The project's primary linter is oxlint (`pnpm lint`). This config adds only
 * the React Hooks + React Compiler rule set from `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
 * (`recommended-latest`), which oxlint does not implement. Those rules flag the
 * Rules of React violations that cause the React Compiler to silently skip
 * ("bail out" on) a component, so they keep the codebase compiler-friendly.
 *
 * Run via `pnpm --filter @reflect/desktop lint:react`, and wired into the
 * repo-wide `pnpm lint` so it gates CI alongside oxlint.
 *
 * @see https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler
