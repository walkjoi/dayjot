# macOS Distribution Builds

How to produce a signed, notarized macOS build of Reflect for distribution outside the
Mac App Store.

```bash
pnpm release:macos setup           # once: store notarization credentials in the keychain
pnpm release:macos setup-updater   # once: generate the auto-update signing keypair
pnpm release:macos                 # signed + notarized build, verified end to end
pnpm release:macos publish         # the above, then upload the DMG + updater artifacts to a new GitHub release
```

The helper lives at `apps/desktop/scripts/release-macos.mjs` and is exposed as
`pnpm release:macos` from the repo root.

## What you need

1. **A Developer ID Application certificate** in your login keychain. This certificate
   type (not "Apple Distribution", which is App Store only) is required for distribution
   outside the App Store, and only the Apple Developer **Account Holder** can create one,
   at [developer.apple.com → Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates).
   Confirm it's installed with:

   ```bash
   security find-identity -v -p codesigning
   ```

2. **An Apple ID on the team with an app-specific password** for notarization. Create the
   password at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com) → Sign-In and Security →
   App-Specific Passwords, then run `pnpm release:macos setup`. The setup command stores
   it in your login keychain (item `reflect-notary`) — the password never touches shell
   history or the repo.

3. **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`) for `notarytool` and `stapler`.

4. **The updater signing key** (for `publish`). Auto-update payloads are verified against
   the minisign public key committed in `tauri.conf.json` (`plugins.updater.pubkey`) —
   distinct from Apple signing. `pnpm release:macos setup-updater` generates the keypair,
   stores the private key in your login keychain (item `reflect-updater`), and prints the
   public key to commit. **Losing the private key strands every installed app** (they
   reject anything not signed with it), so back it up; rotating it only reaches users via
   a release signed with the old key that ships the new pubkey.

Nothing signing-related is committed to the repo: contributors without the certificate
can still build unsigned bundles with plain `pnpm tauri build`.

## What `pnpm release:macos` does

1. Auto-detects the Developer ID identity from the keychain and derives the team ID.
2. Loads notarization credentials (keychain item, or environment variables — see
   [Releasing from CI](#releasing-from-ci) below).
3. Runs `pnpm tauri build`, which stages the `reflect` CLI sidecar, then signs inside-out
   (sidecar → main binary → `.app`) with hardened runtime, notarizes the `.app` via
   `notarytool`, staples the ticket, and builds + signs the DMG.
4. Notarizes and staples the **DMG** itself. Tauri only notarizes the `.app`; without its
   own ticket the DMG container fails `spctl --type open` and downloads can hit
   Gatekeeper friction.
5. Verifies everything — `codesign --verify --deep --strict`, Gatekeeper assessment of
   the app and DMG (`accepted` / `source=Notarized Developer ID`), and stapled tickets —
   and fails loudly if any check is off.

Bundles land in `target/release/bundle/macos/Reflect.app` and
`target/release/bundle/dmg/Reflect_<version>_<arch>.dmg`.

## Commands and flags

```bash
pnpm release:macos                 # build + notarize + verify (default)
pnpm release:macos setup           # store Apple ID + app-specific password in the keychain
pnpm release:macos verify          # re-run all checks on already-built bundles
pnpm release:macos publish         # build + notarize + verify, then create a GitHub release
pnpm release:macos publish --draft # same, but leave the release as a draft for review
pnpm release:macos --no-notarize   # signed-only build (runs locally; Gatekeeper rejects it elsewhere)
```

## Cutting a release (`pnpm release:bump`)

The version is declared in three places that must move together —
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and the
`reflect-open` entry in `Cargo.lock`. `pnpm release:bump` edits all three, commits the
bump on a short-lived release branch, pushes that branch, opens and immediately merges a
PR back to the protected release branch, then pushes the `v<version>` tag from the
merged commit. That tag push triggers the Release workflow to build, sign, notarize, and
publish. You don't run `release:macos` by hand for a normal release.

```bash
pnpm release:bump                # cut the next beta: 0.2.0-beta.1 → 0.2.0-beta.2
pnpm release:bump stable         # drop the prerelease: 0.2.0-beta.3 → 0.2.0
pnpm release:bump patch          # 0.2.0 → 0.2.1   (also: minor, major)
pnpm release:bump preminor       # open a new beta cycle: 0.2.0 → 0.3.0-beta.1
pnpm release:bump 0.5.0-beta.1   # set an explicit version
pnpm release:bump --dry-run      # show the plan, change nothing
pnpm release:bump --tag-only     # recovery: push the tag for an already-merged bump
```

Default (no argument) is `beta`, the common case on `next`. The script refuses to run on
a dirty tree or a branch out of sync with origin, and refuses a version whose tag already
exists. Releases are branch-independent: the version string picks the channel (a
`-beta.N` prerelease publishes to the beta feed, a plain version to the stable feed) and
the build pins the matching updater feed (`release-macos.mjs`), so a stable release can be
cut straight from `next` without ever polling the wrong feed. It requires the GitHub CLI
(`gh`) for the protected-branch PR flow, merges the release PR immediately with admin
bypass instead of waiting for CI, prints the plan, and asks for confirmation (skip with
`--yes`).

The typical flows, both on `next`:

- **Beta**: `pnpm release:bump`.
- **Stable**: `pnpm release:bump minor` (or `patch`/`major`), then `pnpm release:bump
  preminor` to open the next beta cycle.

`--direct` keeps the old direct-push behavior for repositories or maintainers that have
an explicit ruleset bypass. With `--direct`, `--no-tag` bumps and pushes the branch
without tagging, for when you want the version commit but aren't ready to release.
`--tag-only` is a recovery path for a release PR that was merged without the tag push.

## Publishing to GitHub Releases

`pnpm release:macos publish` runs the full build above, then creates a GitHub release
tagged `v<version>` (the `version` in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) with the
notarized DMG, the updater artifacts (`Reflect.app.tar.gz` + `.sig`), and the
`latest.json` manifest attached, plus auto-generated release notes. Stable installs poll
`releases/latest/download/latest.json`; beta installs poll
`releases/download/updater-beta/latest.json`, a moving feed release that points at the
newest published beta. Publish requires the updater key and always attaches the
manifest — a release without it would stop existing installs from seeing any future
updates. Beyond the signing
requirements, it needs the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) authenticated with
`gh auth login`.

All preflight checks run before the build, so a doomed publish fails in seconds rather
than after notarization:

- the working tree is clean and `HEAD` is on an `origin` branch — the release tag is
  created at that exact commit;
- no release for `v<version>` exists yet, and any existing `v<version>` tag on origin
  points at `HEAD` (`gh` reuses an existing tag, which would release the wrong commit).
  Publishing a new release means bumping `version` in `tauri.conf.json` first (keep
  `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` in step).

Pass `--draft` to create the release without publishing it, then review and publish it
from the GitHub UI.

## Beta releases

Development happens on `next` (the repo default branch); `master` only advances when
`next` is merged into it for a public release. On `next`, `version` in
`tauri.conf.json` carries a prerelease suffix (e.g. `0.2.0-beta.1`), and `publish`
turns that suffix into a GitHub **pre-release** automatically. `releases/latest` ignores
pre-releases, so stable installs never see a beta.

Beta builds use the dedicated `updater-beta` feed instead. Every non-draft beta publish
uploads the beta's `latest.json` to that fixed release with `--clobber`; the manifest
still points at the immutable versioned release artifacts for the actual download. Draft
beta releases do not update the feed.

`pnpm release:bump` keeps the channel endpoint in `tauri.conf.json` in sync with the
version it writes: prerelease versions poll the beta feed, stable versions poll
`releases/latest`.

Cutting a beta is the normal release flow on `next`: `pnpm release:bump` (see
[Cutting a release](#cutting-a-release-pnpm-releasebump) above) bumps the prerelease
version and pushes the tag that triggers the workflow. For a stable release, merge
`next` into `master` and run `pnpm release:bump stable` there.

## Build flavors (Reflect / Reflect Beta / Reflect Dev)

Three flavors ship as distinct, coexisting apps:

| Flavor       | Branch   | productName  | identifier                 | Icon         | Updater feed      |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Reflect      | `master` | Reflect      | `app.reflect.desktop`      | blue/violet  | `releases/latest` |
| Reflect Beta | `next`   | Reflect Beta | `app.reflect.desktop.beta` | purple/violet | `updater-beta`    |
| Reflect Dev  | local    | Reflect Dev  | `app.reflect.desktop.dev`  | green        | `updater-dev-noop` (no-op) |

The base `tauri.conf.json` is the stable flavor and uses the shipped gradient icon
(`icons/`). Beta and dev are config overlays (`src-tauri/tauri.beta.conf.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json`) merged with `--config`; their icons are the same
artwork recolored via `magick -modulate` (beta `104,100,120`, dev `92,100,231`; see
`src-tauri/icons/README.md`). `release:macos` picks the flavor from the version
(prerelease → beta, else stable), so a release always matches the updater feed compiled
into it; `release.yml` needs no flavor knowledge and `release:bump` is unchanged.

Each overlay pins its own updater feed so the flavor is self-consistent regardless of the
base config's channel: beta → `updater-beta`, dev → a deliberately non-existent
`updater-dev-noop` feed so dev builds never find an update (in `tauri dev` the updater is
off anyway). The stable feed lives on the base config and is managed by `release:bump`.

Distinct identifiers give each flavor its own webview storage and embeddings cache.
Settings, recent graphs and keychain secrets are currently **shared** across flavors (the
`reflect-open` config dir and keychain service are hardcoded, not derived from the
identifier).

Local builds:

```bash
pnpm tauri:dev                                   # run Reflect Dev (green), isolated identifier
pnpm tauri:build:dev                             # bundle Reflect Dev
pnpm tauri:build:beta                            # bundle Reflect Beta locally (unsigned)
pnpm release:macos --flavor=beta --no-notarize   # signed-only beta, for local checks
```

Because GitHub rewrites spaces in uploaded asset names to dots, the updater manifest URL
for "Reflect Beta" is sanitized to `Reflect.Beta.app.tar.gz` in `writeUpdaterManifest`.
Do not "fix" the space back, or beta auto-update 404s.

**Beta tester migration (one-time):** before flavors, beta builds were a plain "Reflect"
(`app.reflect.desktop`) that merely polled the beta feed. The first flavored beta is a new
app (`app.reflect.desktop.beta`, "Reflect Beta"), so existing beta installs do not migrate
cleanly. Tell testers to delete the old "Reflect" beta and install "Reflect Beta" fresh.
Stable installs are unaffected (same identifier and the shipped icon).

## Releasing from CI

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `pnpm release:macos publish` on a GitHub-hosted
macOS runner — the same pipeline as a local release, including DMG notarization, the
Gatekeeper checks, and the updater artifacts. Trigger it from **Actions → Release →
Run workflow** (tick *draft* to review the release before publishing), or by pushing
the matching `v<version>` tag. The publish preflights apply unchanged, so bump
`version` in `tauri.conf.json` (and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`) on the released branch
first.

The script reads all signing material from environment variables, which take
precedence over the keychain (exporting them works for local releases too); the
workflow wires them from repository Actions secrets of the same names. Create these
under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Full identity string, e.g. `Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)` — from `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | The Developer ID certificate + private key: export a `.p12` from Keychain Access, then `base64 -i certificate.p12`. Tauri imports it into a temporary keychain on the runner |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password set on that `.p12` export |
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | App Store Connect API key ID, for notarization (preferred in CI — not tied to a personal Apple ID) |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | The API key's issuer UUID |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT` | The `.p8` key file's content; the workflow stages it on disk and sets `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`, the variable the script reads |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` | The updater private key: `security find-generic-password -s reflect-updater -w \| base64 --decode` |

Notes:

- Apple ID notarization works instead of the API key: set `APPLE_ID` +
  `APPLE_PASSWORD` (an app-specific password), plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` if the signing
  identity doesn't end in `(TEAMID)`.
- Leave `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` unset: the key has no password, GitHub
  rejects empty-string secrets, and the workflow defaults it to empty. (Locally,
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` also works in place of the key content.)
- No PAT is needed — the release is created with the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The workflow verifies the secrets before building, so a misconfigured runner fails in
seconds rather than after the build and notarization. See the
[Tauri macOS signing docs](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/) for background
on the runner keychain setup.

## Troubleshooting

- **`no "Developer ID Application" certificate found`** — the cert isn't in your *login*
  keychain, or it's the wrong type. An invalid/incomplete cert won't show up in
  `security find-identity` at all.
- **Notarization fails (`status: Invalid`)** — the script automatically prints the notary
  log, which lists each offending file. Common cause: a binary that wasn't signed with
  hardened runtime.
- **`rejected, source=Unnotarized Developer ID`** — signing worked but the artifact has no
  notarization ticket; rerun without `--no-notarize`.
- **Notarization hangs** — Apple's service occasionally queues submissions for a long
  time; check status with `xcrun notarytool history --apple-id <id> --team-id <team>`.

## Current limitations

- Builds target the host architecture only (Apple Silicon in practice). A universal
  build needs the `x86_64-apple-darwin` rustup target, a universal sidecar from
  `scripts/build-sidecar.mjs`, and `pnpm tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin`.
- The iOS project template (`src-tauri/ios.project.yml`) still uses the pre-rename bundle
  identifier and needs its own provisioning pass.
- `latest.json` only lists the host architecture, so auto-update serves the arch that was
  built (Apple Silicon in practice); the universal-build work above lifts both limits.
