# iCloud Drive Sync

How DayJot syncs a graph through iCloud Drive (Plan 21 —
[design](plans/21-icloud-drive-sync.md)), and what happens when two devices
edit the same note while apart.

## The user contract

- **Where the graph lives.** In the app's iCloud Drive container — visible as
  **iCloud Drive → DayJot** in Files (iOS) and Finder (macOS). Notes stay
  plain markdown files; iCloud moves them between devices.
- **Turning it on.** Both platforms offer iCloud first during onboarding and
  list every graph already in the container (it can hold several): macOS's
  recommended card opens one or names-and-creates a new one, with a
  self-managed choose-your-own-folder alternative; iOS's first-run screen
  opens one (or stores fresh notes in iCloud), and its settings sheet
  switches between graphs later. An existing
  local graph moves later via Settings → **iCloud sync** → *Move graph to
  iCloud…*, which copies it into the container (verified file-by-file) and
  reopens it there; the original folder stays on disk, untouched, as a
  recovery copy.
- **iCloud or GitHub, not both.** A graph syncs through iCloud Drive *or* a
  Git remote. Two sync engines merging the same files fight each other, and a
  `.git` directory must never ride a file-sync provider (object-store
  corruption). Moving a graph to iCloud disconnects its GitHub backup first,
  and `.git`/`.dayjot` are always marked local-only as a belt-and-braces
  guard.

## What happens on a conflict

When both devices change the same note while apart, DayJot resolves it
itself where that is safe, in this order (deterministic — both devices
resolving the same conflict produce identical bytes and converge):

1. **Same content** (or only whitespace differs) — nothing to do.
2. **Different parts of the note** — merged three-ways over the note's last
   synced state.
3. **Only metadata differs** (pinned on the Mac, marked private on the
   phone) — merged key-by-key.
4. **Both devices appended** — the daily-note case, and the most common one:
   both tails are kept, oldest first. Two devices creating the same day's
   note offline (iCloud leaves a `2026-07-04 2.md` behind) fold back into one
   file the same way.
5. **Genuinely overlapping edits** — the note keeps *both* versions between
   labeled conflict markers, opens protected, and shows a **Needs review**
   banner whose buttons name the devices ("Keep 'Alex's MacBook Pro'").
   Nothing is ever discarded silently.

Before any resolution is written, every involved version is archived under
`.dayjot/conflict-archive/<note-path>/` (kept ~90 days / 20 versions per
note), so even a bad merge is recoverable. Binary assets never text-merge:
the other device's copy lands alongside as `name (conflict).ext`.

## Building with iCloud

Dev builds report iCloud as unavailable unless the build is entitled and
provisioned:

- **iOS**: the entitlements + `NSUbiquitousContainers` declaration are in
  `ios.project.yml` / `gen/apple`; Xcode automatic signing registers the
  container (`iCloud.app.dayjot`) on the first entitled build.
- **macOS**: the entitlements live in
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Entitlements.plist`, granted by the committed
  Developer ID provisioning profiles (`DayJot.provisionprofile` /
  `DayJot-beta.provisionprofile`, embedded pre-signing via
  `bundle.macOS.files`). They're bound to one specific Developer ID
  certificate — rotating it, or editing the App IDs' capabilities in the
  portal, means regenerating and re-committing both profiles. The dev flavor
  signs with `Entitlements.dev.plist` (no iCloud — its App ID has no
  profile), and plain contributor builds without DayJot's certificate
  simply report iCloud as unavailable.

Everything below the platform calls — the resolution ladder, the shadow
merge-base store, the conflict sweep — is plain Rust with unit tests
(`cargo test -p dayjot-desktop --lib -- conflict icloud`) and runs identically
in CI. What *needs a real container* (and the two-device manual matrix in
the plan doc) is the `NSMetadataQuery` watch, `NSFileVersion` conflict
delivery, and download/eviction behavior.

## Deliberately not here (yet)

- **AI-assisted resolution** — the ladder already produces the
  base/local/remote triple a BYOK provider would consume; see the plan's
  *Deferred* section. `private: true` notes will be hard-blocked from it.
- A richer diff view than raw markers in the protected note.
- Upload/download progress in the sync status line.
