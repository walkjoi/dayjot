# Porting Reflect V1 Mobile features to Reflect v2 mobile

This directory documents the user-facing behavior of Reflect V1 Mobile —
the Capacitor 6 + Ionic React iOS companion app in the separate
`reflect-mobile` repository — so it can be ported, feature by feature, to
the v2 mobile app (the Tauri 2 iOS target of this repo, Plan 19). Each doc
describes what V1 mobile does in enough detail to rebuild the behavior,
what must change in v2 and why, and how the feature maps onto v2's decided
architecture.

It is the mobile analog of the desktop porting set in
[`docs/porting/`](../README.md), and the detailed companion to the
[V1 Mobile Overview](../../reflect-v1-mobile-overview.md). The binding
decisions live here and win over anything in these docs:

- [Plan 19 (mobile companion)](../../plans/19-mobile.md) — scope, steps,
  acceptance criteria; the 2026-06-12 product call is **re-implement V1
  mobile's feature-set and design**.
- [V2 Mobile Grounding Brief](../../dayjot-v2-mobile-grounding-brief.md) —
  product brief and the V1→V2 surface mapping.
- [TDR 0003 (mobile shell)](../../decisions/0003-mobile-shell.md) — Tauri 2
  mobile chosen; Capacitor is the documented fallback with triggers.
- [Product Vision](../../dayjot-v2-product-vision.md) ·
  [Sync Strategy](../../dayjot-v2-sync-strategy.md) ·
  [Indexing Strategy](../../dayjot-v2-indexing-strategy.md).

## Why features can't be ported directly

v2 removes the three pillars V1 mobile is built on:

- **No servers, no accounts.** Every reliable V1 capture path (share
  extension, audio upload, push, OAuth token exchange) worked by POSTing
  to Reflect's API or Firebase with natively-stored tokens. v2 has no
  backend: the phone is a peer device holding real markdown files, and
  network egress in mobile v1 is GitHub sync only.
- **No E2EE, no encrypted database.** V1 mobile decrypts an encrypted
  Firestore/SQLite graph behind an unlock gate. v2 notes are plain
  markdown in the app's `Documents/` directory (Files-app visible); SQLite
  under `.reflect/` is a rebuildable per-device projection.
- **No Capacitor.** V1's seven custom Capacitor plugins and its rsync
  code-sharing scheme with the web repo dissolve. Native capabilities V1
  got as plugins (keyboard, haptics, camera, share, secure storage) are
  rebuilt as first-party Tauri plugins or web APIs; app extensions (share,
  widgets, intents) become native iOS targets beside the Tauri shell in
  later waves.

What survives is the **product behavior**: open-to-today with swipeable
days, a keyboard that behaves, instant offline search, capture that is
never lost. That behavior is what these docs pin down.

## The docs

| Doc                                                                   | V1 mobile feature                         | v2 status (per Plan 19)                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [App shell and navigation](./app-shell-and-navigation.md)             | Tab bar, routing, boot gates, FAB          | **v1** — Daily/All shell shipped-in-progress      |
| [Daily notes](./daily-notes.md)                                       | Day carousel + calendar strip              | **v1** — Embla carousel, V1 design parity         |
| [Editor and keyboard](./editor-and-keyboard.md)                       | Mobile editor + native accessory toolbar   | **v1** editing; toolbar deliberately re-designed  |
| [Search and All Notes](./search-and-all-notes.md)                     | FTS search, filters, list, AI search chat  | **v1** list+search; filters partial, chat later   |
| [Tasks](./tasks.md)                                                   | Task groups, drag-and-drop, quick edit     | **Shipped** — desktop Plan 18 data + touch surface |
| [Note actions, sharing, export](./note-actions-sharing-and-export.md) | Pin/share/publish/trash, JSON export       | **v1** pin/share/trash; publish deferred          |
| [Audio memos](./audio-memos.md)                                       | Native recording + server transcription    | Later wave — raw-first + BYOK transcription       |
| [Share extension](./share-extension.md)                               | Share-sheet link capture via API           | **Done** — App Group inbox → relay → shared drain |
| [Native entry points](./native-entry-points.md)                       | Widgets, Siri, quick actions, deep links   | Later waves / partially dropped                   |
| [Sync, offline, and data](./sync-offline-and-data.md)                 | Firestore↔SQLite sync, Yjs, job queue      | Replaced — behavior ports, architecture doesn't   |
| [Assets and images](./assets-and-images.md)                           | Encrypted asset cache + custom scheme      | Replaced — assets are plain files                 |
| [Auth, encryption, accounts](./auth-encryption-and-accounts.md)       | Sign-in, unlock, recovery kit, tokens      | **Dropped** — no accounts, no E2EE                |

## Conventions

- Unqualified paths like `client/screens/…`, `capacitor/…`, and
  `ios/App/…` are in the **`reflect-mobile` repo**; paths like
  `apps/desktop/src/mobile/…` and `packages/core/…` are in **this repo**
  (mobile is a build target of the one app — there is no `apps/mobile`).
- "Graph" is the user's workspace: in v2 a folder of markdown files with
  daily notes at `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; in V1 mobile a set of encrypted
  documents with date IDs (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- In `reflect-mobile`, directories under `client/actions`, most of
  `client/models`, `helpers`, `lib`, `shared`, and `services` are
  **rsynced from the V1 web repo** (`sync.sh` + `sync-include.txt`) —
  shared V1 domain code. Mobile-owned code is `client/core/`,
  `client/screens/`, `client/models/ui/`, `client/models/capacitor/`,
  `components/`, `capacitor/` (plugin bridges), and `ios/` (Xcode project
  and Swift).
- V1 behavior described here was verified against the `reflect-mobile`
  codebase in 2026-07; it is a snapshot, not a living spec.
