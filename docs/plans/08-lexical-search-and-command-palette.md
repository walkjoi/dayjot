# Plan 08 — Lexical Search & Command Palette

**Goal:** The `⌘K` surface: fast local full-text + title search, structured filters,
navigation commands, and command execution — the primary recall + navigation entry point.

**Depends on:** Plan 04 (FTS + projections), Plan 06 (routes/date navigation).
**Unlocks:** results usable as AI context (Plan 10), CLI search (Plan 14), and the
command registry that deep links/CLI reuse later.

**Libraries:** `cmdk` (⌘K palette) + shadcn/ui; FTS via `rusqlite` (Plan 04). See
[Libraries](libraries.md).

## Scope

**In:** `⌘K` palette, FTS over titles/body, title/fuzzy match, backlink-aware filters,
date/tag/pinned-style filters, navigation commands (today, relative dates, open note),
command execution, keyboard-only operation, result preview/open.
**Out:** semantic/vector search (Plan 09 — same surface, additive), AI chat over results
(Plan 10).

**Recorded non-goals (decided 2026-06-09):** the ambiguous-`[[link]]` disambiguation
picker (deferred from Plan 07) stays deferred — deterministic resolution holds until a
later wave gives it a deliberate UX; the global status surface is **not** Plan 08 scope
because it lands beforehand as its own foundations pass (the `operations` store +
`OperationsStatus`, with the rename rewrite as first tenant).

## Delivery split (decided 2026-06-09)

**Pre-work — foundations pass (own PR, before 08a):** consolidate the two
module-global registries (quit-flush, path→session) into one `open-documents`
service; add the app-global `operations` store + `OperationsStatus` surface
(product status, not spinners — running entries with optional progress,
failures linger so backgrounded errors aren't lost); route the rename
coordinator's progress/errors through it, replacing the pane-local progress
banner. Keeps 08a purely about search + palette.

- **08a — palette, lexical search, command registry (the spine):**
  1. `cmdk` palette shell in a `⌘K` modal registered through the app-scope
     keymap registry; keyboard-native throughout.
  2. **Typed command registry** (`src/lib/commands/`): the `Command` contract
     below; the existing hardcoded `⌘D/⌘N/⌘[/⌘]` shortcuts **migrate into
     registry entries** whose keybindings register through the keymap registry
     — one source of truth that deep links and the CLI (Plan 14) reuse.
     First-wave commands: go to today, new note, go to date (typed ISO),
     open random note, toggle theme, rebuild index.
  3. **Lexical search.** Empty palette = **recent notes only** (decided — the
     zero-keystroke recall path; commands surface when the query matches one,
     `>` prefix filters to commands). Typed queries: FTS5 with a **bm25 title
     boost** and `snippet()` **match highlights** (decided: snippets only, no
     preview pane in the first wave), merged with fuzzy title matches for
     jump-to-note (reusing Plan 07a's exact < prefix < substring ranking).
     Reads via TanStack Query under the `['index', root, …]` scope — the
     post-apply invalidation from Plan 07a already keeps them fresh.
  4. **`search/:query` opens the palette pre-filled** (decided) — the route
     stays a deep-link/CLI target without a second search surface to keep
     consistent with the palette.
  5. **Result model:** one ranked list with sections (Notes / Dailies /
     Commands); Enter navigates via the route model or runs the command.
     Debounced input, small caps, index-only.
- **08b — filters** *(delivered 2026-06-09, stacked on 08a)*: typed filter
  tokens parsed from the query (`#tag`, `is:daily`, `links:Note` /
  `links:"Multi Word"`, `linked-from:Note`, `updated:>YYYY-MM-DD`, `<`, or
  bare for that day — local-time, against `mtime` epoch ms) → composable
  predicates over the notes projection (EXISTS subqueries against `tags` and
  the `backlinks` view; link targets resolve through the shared resolver, and
  an unresolvable target matches nothing rather than silently ignoring the
  filter). Free text constrains + ranks through FTS as in 08a; without text,
  results order by recency — a filtered recall feed. A malformed token
  (impossible date, empty value) stays search text, so typing never hides
  results behind a half-formed filter. Chips UI can follow the grammar later.

**`updated:` semantics note (accepted 2026-06-09):** the filter compares file
`mtime`, which DayJot's own background writes also touch — a rename rewrite
updates every source file it edits, so `updated:D` can include notes the
*system* wrote that day, not just the user. Accepted for the first wave; the
durable fix is content-authored timestamps (frontmatter or index-tracked),
which can join when an editing-history feature needs them anyway.

**Tokenizer note:** `search_fts` was created with the default `unicode61`
tokenizer. If recall on code identifiers/CJK proves poor, switching (e.g. to
`trigram`) needs an FTS-rebuilding migration — cheap, since the index is a
rebuildable cache, but it is a migration.

## Steps

1. **Command palette shell** (`src/components/command-palette/`): a `⌘K` modal
   (shadcn `command` / cmdk) that is keyboard-native — open, type, arrow, Enter, Esc.
   Single surface for **find + navigate + do**, matching V1's three jobs for search.

2. **Lexical search.** Query FTS5 (Plan 04) over title + body; rank by relevance with a
   title boost. Add fuzzy title matching for jump-to-note. Return snippets with match
   highlights; Enter opens (navigates via Plan 06 route model), preview on focus.

3. **Filters.** Structured filters expressed as UI chips → query constraints: tag,
   created/updated date ranges, daily-notes-only, links-to/linked-from a note
   (backlink-aware via Plan 04). Keep the filter set small and composable for first wave.

4. **Navigation + commands via a typed command registry.** Define a `Command` contract
   (id, title, args schema, keybinding, run) and register: go to today, go to date /
   "N days from now", new note, open random note, toggle theme, open settings, rebuild
   index, etc. The palette lists and runs commands; the **same registry is the future
   integration point for deep links and the CLI** (don't build three command systems).

   ```ts
   // src/lib/commands/command.ts
   export interface Command<Args = void> {
     id: string
     title: string
     keybinding?: string
     run: (args: Args) => void | Promise<void>
   }
   ```

5. **Result model.** Unify notes, daily dates, and commands into one ranked result list
   with clear sections, so one keystroke flow covers everything. Recent/most-relevant
   first when the query is empty.

6. **Performance.** Sub-50ms typical query on a large graph via FTS + small result caps +
   debounced input. Index-backed, never a file scan.

7. **Tests.** FTS ranking + title boost; filter → constraint translation; command
   registry execution; keyboard-only flow (open → filter → Enter opens correct route).

## Key decisions / contracts

- **One `⌘K` surface** for find/navigate/do.
- **A single typed command registry** powers the palette now and deep links/CLI later.
- **Search is index-backed**, never a filesystem scan.

## Acceptance criteria

- `⌘K` opens instantly; typing returns ranked note + command results with highlights.
- Filters (tag, date, daily-only, linked-from) narrow results correctly.
- "Go to today", "N days from now", "new note", "random note" work from the palette.
- Entire flow is operable without the mouse.
- `pnpm typecheck` + tests pass.

## Risks

- **Doing too much in one box** (find + navigate + command) hurting clarity. Mitigate
  with clear result sectioning + ranking, validated by keyboard-flow tests.
- **FTS tokenization** for code/identifiers/CJK. Pick a tokenizer (e.g. `unicode61`/
  `trigram`) deliberately; revisit if recall is poor.
- **Filter combinatorics** bloating the query builder. Keep the first-wave filter set
  intentionally small.
