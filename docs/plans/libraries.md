# Libraries & Dependencies

Canonical record of the libraries chosen for each plan step (decided with the user and
checked against `package.json`/`Cargo.toml` on 2026-06-14). The foundational libraries
installed in Plan 01 are listed first for completeness; later phases name the additions
they bring in. Licensing is **MIT-core** — meowdown is first-party (owned by the team)
and MIT-licensed, so there is no copyleft constraint.

## Installed in Plan 01 (foundation)

- **Monorepo / build:** pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, TypeScript, Vite, `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- **UI:** React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), shadcn primitives via
  `radix-ui`, `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` (the `cn` helper), `lucide-react`.
- **Validation:** `zod`.
- **Database:** `kysely` (query builder, TS); `rusqlite` (bundled) + `sqlite-vec` (Rust).
- **Editor:** meowdown (`@meowdown/react`, `@meowdown/core`) on ProseKit (`@prosekit/*`) +
  `@lezer/markdown`.
- **Forms:** `react-hook-form`.
- **Test:** `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `jsdom`.

## Notes & caveats

- **Plan 13 is closed by product decision:** no ZIP, JSON, HTML export, or dedicated
  Reflect V1 migration dependencies are planned. The graph folder's markdown files and
  assets are the portability surface.
- **The CLI (Plan 14) is a Rust binary** (superseding the earlier `cac` + `node:sqlite`
  Node-CLI choice): rusqlite `bundled` gives the same SQLite + FTS5 as the desktop app via
  one workspace lockfile, and the binary ships as a Tauri sidecar. `saphyr` is chosen for
  read-only frontmatter because `serde_yaml` is unmaintained.
- **`fastembed` (Plan 09)** uses ONNX Runtime, which ships a dylib that must be signed for
  notarization (Plan 15). `candle` (pure Rust, no dylib) was the alternative, not chosen.
- **Auto-update (Plan 15):** first-class via the official Tauri updater plugin
  (`tauri-plugin-updater` + `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`), updater-signed payloads,
  `latest.json` + artifacts hosted on **GitHub Releases** (static — not a DayJot-hosted
  API). License/dependency scanning stays **manual** for now.
- **Routing (Plan 06)** stays dependency-free: a small typed `Route` union + history stack.
