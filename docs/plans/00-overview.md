# Reflect V2 — First-Version Implementation Roadmap

This directory holds the numbered, dependency-ordered plans for building the **first
version (first wave)** of Reflect V2: the open-source, local-first, markdown-native,
AI-native rewrite described in the product docs.

Read these alongside the source docs they implement:

- [V2 Product Vision](../reflect-v2-product-vision.md)
- [V2 Indexing Strategy](../reflect-v2-indexing-strategy.md)
- [V2 Sync Strategy](../reflect-v2-sync-strategy.md)
- [V2 Grounding Brief](../reflect-v2-grounding-brief.md)
- [V1 Overview](../reflect-v1-overview.md)
- Repo conventions: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)

## How to read this set

Each plan is one phase. A phase has a **goal**, **depends on / unlocks**, **scope**
(explicit in/out), **steps**, **key decisions/contracts** (with code sketches),
**acceptance criteria**, and **risks**. Build them roughly in order — later phases
assume the contracts defined in earlier ones.

The product vision is explicit: **do not start with screens.** Start by defining
contracts (document model, workspace model, projection model, sync model, assistant
model, route model). The plan ordering reflects that — storage and the index land
before the editor, and the editor lands before search/AI.

> **Read first:** [Architecture & Conventions](architecture-conventions.md) — the
> cross-cutting decisions (Turborepo monorepo, **TS `core` / Rust primitives**, the
> per-domain **actions** pattern, full Kysely discipline) that every plan below assumes.
> Chosen libraries (TS + Rust) per step are recorded in [Libraries](libraries.md).

## Milestone map

The phases group into shippable milestones. Each milestone is independently
demonstrable.

- **M0 — Walking skeleton** (Plans 01–02): app boots, user picks a graph folder, Rust
  reads/writes a markdown file round-trip.
- **M1 — Notes you can write** (Plans 03, 05, 06; index **04 can lag**): parser + editor +
  daily notes. *First genuinely usable build:* open today's note, write markdown, files
  land on disk, reopen. **Sequencing insight (review):** the editor and daily notes read/
  write files directly and **don't need the SQLite index** — only search/backlinks do. So
  ship M1 file-only with a no-op indexer, and land Plan 04 (the index) **with M2**, where
  it's actually needed. This shrinks M1 (which was overloaded) and de-risks the bespoke
  Kysely-over-IPC layer by not blocking "usable" on it.
- **M2 — A connected graph you can find** (Plans 07–09): backlinks, `⌘K` lexical
  search, then local semantic search.
- **M3 — AI-native** (Plan 10): the right-sidebar copilot over local context.
- **M4 — Capture & durability** (Plans 11–13): link capture, backup/sync, import/export.
- **M5 — Reach & release** (Plans 14–15): CLI, hardening, packaging, open-source launch.

## Dependency graph (abridged)

```text
01 ─┬─ 02 ─┬─ 03 ─┬─ 04 ─┬─ 05 ─ 06 ─┬─ 07 ─┬─ 08 ─ 09 ─ 10
    │      │      │      │           │      │
    │      │      │      └───────────┴──────┘  (index feeds backlinks + search)
    │      │      └─ 13 (import/export needs the doc model)
    │      └─ 11 (capture writes via the file/IO + daily-note contract)
    └─ 12 (GitHub-only backup/sync; thin internal seam, after M1)
14 (CLI) reuses 02+03+04.  15 (release) gates everything.
```

## Top risks (from plan review)

The highest-severity risks surfaced reviewing this plan, with where they're handled:

1. **meowdown is the core bet and is early (v0.2.0, no wiki-links).** The whole product
   rides a pre-1.0 editor we must extend with `[[ ]]`. **Gate passed:** the Plan 01
   wiki-link spike confirmed lossless `[[ ]]` round-trips + a clean extension path
   ([docs/spikes/meowdown-wiki-links.md](../spikes/meowdown-wiki-links.md)). Residual: it's
   pre-1.0 (we own the extension code, pin versions); CodeMirror-6 live-preview stays the
   documented fallback. *Licensing is resolved — meowdown is first-party MIT.*
2. **A graph inside a cloud-sync folder corrupts the index and fights GitHub.** Remote
   sync is **GitHub-only** (file-sync providers are unsupported by design — Plan 12); but a
   user may still *place* their graph in iCloud/Dropbox, which can replace the SQLite
   `-wal`/`-shm` mid-write. Mitigation: detect cloud roots + warn/recommend a non-synced
   path, exclude `.reflect/`, and relocate the index to app-data as an escape hatch
   (Plan 04; detection in Plan 02).
3. **Durable macOS folder access** (TCC prompts; security-scoped bookmarks if sandboxed) —
   the in-graph decision depends on it; spike + handle in Plans 01/02/15.
4. **Bespoke Kysely-over-IPC dialect** is non-trivial; keep zod to real boundaries and keep
   a named-query-command fallback (Plan 04).
5. **Scope creep in sync/AI:** AI-assisted conflict resolution trimmed out of first wave
   (Plan 12); semantic search kept independently deferrable (Plan 09).

## First-wave scope guardrails

These are the product's hard principles. Every plan must hold them. Restated here so
they are not re-litigated per phase:

- **Markdown is the source of truth.** SQLite under `.reflect/` is a rebuildable
  projection, never durable storage. Any non-rebuildable local state must be justified.
- **No Reflect-hosted APIs.** LLM/transcription/sync calls go directly from the app to
  user-approved providers (BYOK AI providers, GitHub). No proxy through Reflect infra.
- **`private: true` is a hard block.** Such notes' content must never be sent to any
  external service — AI, capture enrichment, conflict resolution, or otherwise.
- **Secrets live in the OS keychain.** Never in markdown, Git, or `.reflect/`.
- **Keyboard-native.** Every core workflow reachable from the keyboard.
- **Portable data + export from day one.** Backup must be free, via **GitHub only**;
  file-sync providers (iCloud/Dropbox/Drive) are unsupported for sync by design.
- **No Electron, no web app, Mac-first.** Tauri shell; iOS/Windows later.
- **MIT open-source core.** Write as if the code is public and will be critiqued. The
  editor [meowdown](https://github.com/prosekit/meowdown) is **first-party** (owned by the
  team) and MIT-licensed, so the MIT core holds with no copyleft constraint.

## Explicitly deferred (NOT first wave)

Do not build these now; keep the door open in the data model. Tasks, audio
transcription, full browser clipper / article extraction, graph-map view, templates,
contacts/calendar, publishing, any non-GitHub sync (iCloud/Dropbox/Drive are unsupported
by design, not "deferred"), a public plugin API, typed-entity layer, and full multi-device
sync conflict automation (incl. AI-assisted resolution). Mobile
is *planned* (capture/read/lexical-search later) but does not block the Mac release;
plans avoid choices that make mobile or Windows impossible.

## Conventions (apply to every plan)

From [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md): TypeScript with no `any`; zod at every data
boundary, normalized to camelCase; kebab-case files; one component per file;
providers + hooks for state; small single-responsibility modules; Kysely for DB types;
Tailwind + shadcn (`components/ui`) + Lucide; document all public APIs; run
`pnpm typecheck` and targeted `pnpm test --run` before declaring a phase done.
