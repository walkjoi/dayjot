# The `reflect` CLI

A small, self-contained read/discovery CLI over a Reflect graph (Plan 14). It
reads the graph's markdown files directly and opens `.reflect/index.sqlite`
strictly read-only — no running desktop app required. It never writes: markdown
edits are the write path, and the index is refreshed by the desktop app.

```
reflect today              # print today's daily note
reflect today --path       # its absolute path (works before the file exists)
reflect search <query>     # ranked full-text search over the index
reflect show <note>        # print a note by date, path, title, or alias
reflect path <note>        # resolve a note to its absolute path
reflect open <note>        # open a note in the app (reflect:// deep link)
```

Built from `apps/cli` (`cargo build -p reflect-cli`); bundled with the desktop
app as a Tauri sidecar (macOS: `Reflect.app/Contents/MacOS/reflect`, Linux
`.deb`: `/usr/bin/reflect`). For local development:
`cargo install --path apps/cli`.

## Graph resolution

First match wins:

1. `--graph <path>` — must contain a `.reflect/` directory.
2. `$REFLECT_GRAPH` — same requirement.
3. The nearest ancestor of the current directory containing `.reflect/`
   (git-style walk-up).

There is deliberately no fallback to the desktop app's recent-graphs config:
the CLI stays deterministic for scripts and agents.

## Privacy

Notes with `private: true` frontmatter are **invisible through the CLI** — no
content, no paths, no search hits — and there is no flag that overrides this.
`search` filters them out; `show`/`today`/`path` print nothing to stdout,
explain on stderr, and exit `3`. The check reads the resolved file's own
frontmatter (never just the index row), so a stale index can't leak a
just-flagged note.

## Output contract

- **stdout carries only data** (note content, paths, or JSON); all warnings
  and errors go to stderr.
- `--json` emits the stable shapes below — they are the agent/scripting
  contract and are locked by tests (`apps/cli/tests/cli.rs`).

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | runtime error (no graph, IO/SQL failure) |
| 2 | usage error |
| 3 | note not found, or note is private |
| 4 | search index missing or unusable (`search` only) |

## Commands

### `reflect today [--path] [--json]`

Prints today's daily note (`daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, local timezone). File-only —
works with no index. A missing daily is exit `3`; with `--path` the would-be
path is printed even before the file exists (dailies are created lazily, so
this is how editors/scripts create them).

```jsonc
// reflect today --json
{
  "date": "2026-06-11",
  "path": "daily/2026-06-11.md",
  "absolutePath": "/…/graph/daily/2026-06-11.md",
  "title": "2026-06-11",
  "content": "…"
}
// reflect today --path --json adds "exists" and omits title/content:
{ "date": "…", "path": "…", "absolutePath": "…", "exists": false }
```

### `reflect search <query> [--limit N] [--json]`

Lexical search over the graph's FTS index, ranked with the same title-boosted
bm25 weighting as the app's search, snippets included. Terms are matched
literally (FTS5 operators in the query have no special meaning). Requires the
index: if `.reflect/index.sqlite` is missing the exit code is `4` — open the
graph in Reflect to build it; the CLI never runs the indexer. If files on disk diverge from the index (checked by mtime, then
content hash), a staleness warning goes to stderr and `"stale": true` is set —
results still return.

```jsonc
// reflect search "meeting notes" --json
{
  "query": "meeting notes",
  "stale": false,
  "results": [
    { "path": "notes/standup.md", "title": "Standup", "snippet": "…meeting notes…", "score": -1.94 }
  ]
}
```

### `reflect show <note> [--json]`

Resolves `<note>` and prints the raw markdown. Resolution order:

1. A calendar-valid `YYYY-MM-DD` → that daily note.
2. An explicit path (graph-relative like `notes/foo.md`, or absolute inside
   the graph).
3. A title match (case-insensitive, trimmed).
4. An alias match (from `aliases:` frontmatter).

Works with or without the index — when the index is missing, titles/aliases
are derived by scanning the files. Ambiguous matches resolve to the first path
alphabetically and list the others on stderr.

```jsonc
// reflect show "Project X" --json   ("date" is null for non-dailies)
{ "date": null, "path": "notes/project-x.md", "absolutePath": "…", "title": "Project X", "content": "…" }
```

### `reflect path <note> [--json]`

Same resolution, but prints only the absolute path — for piping into editors
and tools (`$EDITOR "$(reflect path 'Project X')"`). A `YYYY-MM-DD` argument
prints the would-be daily path even before the file exists.

```jsonc
// reflect path 2099-01-01 --json   ("date" only appears for dailies)
{ "date": "2099-01-01", "path": "daily/2099-01-01.md", "absolutePath": "…", "exists": false }
```

### `reflect open <note> [--print] [--json]`

Same resolution, then navigates the Reflect app there by handing the OS URL
opener the note's `reflect://` deep link ([docs/deep-links.md](deep-links.md)).
The URL prefers the most durable address the note has: the date form for
dailies (which need not exist yet — navigation creates them lazily), the
frontmatter `id` form when the note carries one (it survives renames), else
the graph-relative path form. The CLI never writes, so it does not mint ids —
"Copy deep link" in the app does that.

The URL is always printed to stdout; `--print` skips launching the opener —
the scriptable half. Private notes are refused (exit `3`) like every other
CLI surface, before their address leaks.

```jsonc
// reflect open "Project X" --json --print   ("date" only appears for dailies)
{ "path": "notes/project-x.md", "url": "reflect://note/01hzy3…", "launched": false }
```

## For agents

The five commands plus `--json` are the supported automation surface (e.g.
`~/.agents` discovery workflows). The JSON field names and exit codes above
are stable; new fields may be added, existing ones won't change meaning.
Reading a private note is not possible through this surface by design — don't
work around it by reading graph files directly unless the user asked for that.

Settings → Agents installs a per-graph agent skill
(`~/.agents/skills/reflect-<graph-slug>/SKILL.md`) that teaches coding agents
this contract: the graph's root, the bundled CLI's path, the commands, and
the privacy rules. The file carries a `reflect-managed` sha256 marker so the
app can refresh its own installs without ever overwriting a hand-edited one
(`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skill.rs`).

## Development notes

- The CLI deliberately duplicates a thin read-side contract from
  `@reflect/core` (path conventions, fold keys, frontmatter coercions, title
  derivation, SHA-256 hashing, FTS match syntax). Each Rust module names its
  TS counterpart, and the contract is pinned by the shared parity corpus in
  [`fixtures/parity/`](../fixtures/parity/README.md): TS generates
  `expected.json` from the real core pipeline, the Rust tests assert against
  it, so neither side can change without the other following in the same PR.
  Don't grow the surface.
- The sidecar is staged by `apps/desktop/scripts/build-sidecar.mjs` into
  `apps/desktop/src-tauri/binaries/` (gitignored), which Tauri's
  `bundle.externalBin` (desktop platform overlay configs) picks up. tauri-build
  requires that file to exist before the desktop crate compiles — `pnpm tauri
  dev`/`build` stage it automatically; before a bare `cargo build/test
  --workspace`, run `pnpm --filter @reflect/desktop sidecar` once.
