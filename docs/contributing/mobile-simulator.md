# Running the iOS simulator

DayJot mobile is the iOS target of `apps/desktop`, so the simulator dev loop
uses Tauri's iOS command rather than a separate app package.

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm tauri:ios:dev "iPhone 17 Pro"
```

The root `tauri:ios:dev` script delegates to `apps/desktop`, so the command
runs the usual sidecar step and starts Vite through Tauri's
`beforeDevCommand`. On a physical device, run `pnpm tauri:ios:dev --host`
instead.

The script applies `src-tauri/tauri.ios.dev.conf.json`, and debug builds are
the dev flavor: they install as `DayJot Dev` (`app.dayjot.ios.dev`, own
icon, own `group.app.dayjot.dev` App Group, no iCloud), so they coexist with
the TestFlight/App Store app instead of colliding with its install record.
Plain `tauri ios dev` no longer works on its own: it would build the dev
bundle id but try to launch `app.dayjot.ios`.

To see simulator names:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

The first run can be quiet for a while because Xcode is compiling the Rust
crate, the Swift keyboard plugin, and native dependencies for
`aarch64-apple-ios-sim`. A healthy launch eventually prints the Plan 19 probe
lines from `spike_mobile.rs`:

```text
[plan19-spike] PASS: keychain round-trip
[plan19-spike] PASS: sqlite fts5
[plan19-spike] PASS: documents file io
[plan19-spike] PASS: libgit2 init+commit
```

## The software keyboard

The simulator hides the software keyboard whenever "Connect Hardware
Keyboard" is enabled (I/O → Keyboard, ⇧⌘K) — focusing the editor then
types through the Mac keyboard with no on-screen keyboard and no
`keyboardChange` events, which looks like a keyboard bug but isn't. Turn
that setting off (or press ⌘K with the app focused) to exercise the real
keyboard-avoidance path.

`tauri ios dev` may normalize generated files under
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/apple/`, including `project.pbxproj` quoting and
merged `Info.plist` usage descriptions. Inspect those diffs before committing;
when the generated output is intentionally refreshed, update the source
template in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/ios.project.yml` or
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/Info.plist` first.
