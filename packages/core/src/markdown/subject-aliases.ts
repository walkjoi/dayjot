 * V2's canonical alias mechanism is `aliases:` frontmatter; this module is a
 * derived compatibility layer for imported or v1-style-authored titles. The
 * segments are computed at index time and land in the same `aliases`
 * projection — nothing is migrated into frontmatter, and the title itself
 * stays the literal `//` string.
 *
 * Mirrored by `subject_aliases` in the CLI (`apps/cli/src/note_file.rs`);
 * the parity corpus (`fixtures/parity/`) keeps the two in lockstep.
