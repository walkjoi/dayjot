 * Resolve the note targeted by an automatic backlink, or create it safely.
 * Existing duplicates use the same sorted-first winner as read-only wiki-link
 * resolution. That ambiguity must not block durable capture, and no new note
 * is created in that case. An unavailable match (an iCloud placeholder or a
 * failed read) must not block capture either: the requested spelling is kept
 * unchanged and resolves once the note is readable on this device. Returns a
 * link-safe current title so renames keep one section; an unsafe title falls
 * back to the requested spelling that just resolved as its alias.
