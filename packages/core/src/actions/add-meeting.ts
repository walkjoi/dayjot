/**
 * "Add to daily note" for a calendar event — the write half of the calendar
 * integration. Submitting the
 * add-meeting dialog appends v1's exact line shape under the daily note's
 * `## Meetings` heading:
 *
 *     - 9:00am met with [[Ada Lovelace]], [[Bob]] for [[Standup]]
 *
 * and creates the notes those links resolve to when they don't exist yet.
 * With "Create backlinked note" off, the meeting name is plain text (as in
 * v1), not a link — only attendees get `[[Person]]` links and notes.
 *
 * Attendees resolve by invite email first ({@link resolveMeetingAttendees}):
 * a `#person`-tagged note owning the address via a `- Email:` bullet supplies
 * the link name, so a person keeps one note however the calendar spelled
 * them. With the
 * contacts integration on, a fresh
 * person note is named and pre-filled from the Apple Contacts entry matching
 * the attendee's invite email. After that, they are ordinary notes; nothing
 * stays tied to the calendar, and no event metadata is persisted beyond this
 * markdown.
 *
 * Wiki links resolve by title, so "one note per meeting title" holds by
 * construction: a recurring "Standup" links the same `[[Standup]]` note from
 * every day it's added.
 *
 * One deliberate v1 deviation: v1 nested an empty bullet under the line as a
 * note-taking caret target. The v2 serializer drops empty list items (the
 * lazy-daily contract), so writing one would just be normalized away.
