 * is the sole incremental-reindex path and can't corrupt a newly-opened index.
 *
 * Batches can be large — the iCloud metadata query's initial gather reports
 * every downloaded note at once — so applying is batch-shaped end to end:
 * stored facts are prefetched in one query, files whose indexed mtime already
 * matches are skipped without a read, hash-unchanged reads skip the write,
 * changed notes land in shared `index_apply_batch` transactions, and the loop
 * takes an event-loop break every {@link INDEX_PASS_YIELD_EVERY} files.

 * that touch neither notes nor assets (e.g. audio-memo recordings) are skipped
