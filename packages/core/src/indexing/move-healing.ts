/**
 * External-move detection (Plan 17), shared by the open-time reconcile
 * (`indexer.ts`) and the live watcher batch (`live.ts`). Both observe the
 * same shape after a rename DayJot didn't perform: an indexed row whose file
 * vanished (an **orphan**) and an unindexed file that appeared (an
 * **arrival**). When an arrival carries an orphan's frontmatter id, the pair
 * is a move — the caller migrates the rows instead of delete+create, so
 * embedding vectors survive (re-embedding identical content costs the user
 * BYOK money).
 *
 * Detection is best-effort by contract: callers treat a thrown error or a
 * missed pair as "no move detected" and fall back to plain delete+create,
 * which always converges. The healing flow end-to-end (including how the
 * desktop layer carries open sessions and routes along) is documented in
 * `docs/readable-filenames.md`.
