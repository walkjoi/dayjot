# @dayjot/db

The Kysely schema and dialect for DayJot's local SQLite index.

## Design

SQLite runs **in Rust** (it's a native capability); this package only gives
TypeScript a typed query *builder* over it. `createDb(runQuery)` returns a
Kysely instance whose dialect compiles each query to `{ sql, parameters }` and
hands it to the injected runner — in the desktop app that's the `db_query` IPC
command, in tests an in-memory fake. The package itself has no transport
dependency.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **Read-only.** All index writes go through the transactional `index_*`
  commands in Rust, carrying a generation token. The dialect rejects
  transactions, and Rust independently rejects any mutating SQL arriving via
  `db_query` — so the query surface can never write, even if miscompiled.
- **camelCase ↔ snake_case at this boundary.** The `Database` interface is
  camelCase; Kysely's `CamelCasePlugin` maps to the snake_case columns in the
  Rust schema and maps result rows back. Nothing else in the codebase
  translates casing.

Timestamps surface as **epoch-millisecond numbers** (SQLite has no date type);
booleans as **`0 | 1` integers** — readers map them to real booleans at the
getter layer (see `NoteRow.isPrivate` in `@dayjot/core`).

## Schema generation

`Database` types are generated from the Rust migrations:

```bash
pnpm --filter @dayjot/db db:codegen   # rebuilds src/schema.gen.ts
```

Never hand-edit `schema.gen.ts`; add a migration in
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/migrations/` and regenerate.
